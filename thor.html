            <h2>Thor</h2>
            <p>Thor Odinson, the God of Thunder, is a powerful Asgardian warrior who wields the enchanted hammer Mjolnir and fights for justice and peace in the Nine Realms.</p>

            <p>Thor is a superhero created by Stan Lee, Larry Lieber, and Jack Kirby who appears in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The character first appeared in Journey into Mystery #83 (August 1962), and was later featured in The Avengers #85 (October 1963). Thor is the son of Odin, King of Asgard, and the adopted son of the Earthly farmer Joe Broome. He is a member of the superhero team the Avengers and has been portrayed as one of Marvel's most popular characters.</p>

            <p>Thor's character has undergone several changes over the years. In his early appearances, he was depicted as a more traditional superhero with a strong moral code. Over time, his character evolved to include more complex themes such as his relationship with his father Odin and his struggles with power and responsibility.</p>

            <p>Thor has been adapted into various forms of media including films, television series, animated shows, and video games. His portrayal in these adaptations has often emphasized his strength, leadership qualities, and his role as a protector of both Asgard and Earth.</p>
